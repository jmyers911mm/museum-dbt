## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-25

### Infrastructure & Access

**Workspace Migration**
- Moved workspace from private `USER$.PUBLIC."museum-dbt"` to shared `MUSEUM_DW_DEV.PUBLIC."museum-dbt"` for team collaboration
- Created `profiles.yml` (was missing after migration) — targets: dev (`MUSEUM_DW_DEV`) and prod (`MUSEUM_DW_PROD`)

**Git Integration**
- Created `GITHUB_INTEGRATION` API integration (Snowflake GitHub App auth)
- Created `MUSEUM_DW_DEV.PUBLIC.MUSEUM_DBT_REPO` Git Repository stage linked to `https://github.com/jmyers911mm/museum-dbt.git`

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Governance & Configuration Hardening

**`.gitignore`**
- Added `dbt.log` and `graph.gpickle` — both were previously committed; should never be in source control

**`dbt.log` / `graph.gpickle`**
- Purged file contents (2.81 MB log with compiled SQL, connection metadata, execution traces; binary DAG artifact) — files zeroed pending `git rm --cached` in local clone

**`CODEOWNERS`**
- Removed `/profiles.yml` entry — file is already gitignored and should not be committed (convention violation / credential exposure risk)
- Added `/analyses/verified_queries/` — 30 certified VQRs now require reviewer approval

**`dbt_project.yml`**
- Gold dimensions: added `+materialized: table` override — README specifies full rebuild, not inherited `incremental`
- Silver models: added `+on_schema_change: append_new_columns` — prevents silent column drops on incremental runs when Bronze adds columns
- Fixed `+pre-hook` intraday timeout: changed `config.get('tags', [])` → `model.tags` — the previous expression evaluated the project config dict (always empty), so the 300s timeout for intraday-tagged models never fired

**`models/gold/facts/schema.yml`**
- `fct_ticket_utilization`: added `config.deprecation_date: 2026-07-01` — proper dbt deprecation marker (meta-only annotation has no runtime effect)
- `fct_retail_performance`: added `config.deprecation_date: 2026-07-01` — same fix

**`README.md`**
- Project Structure: corrected ML Features model count from "4 models" to "11 models" — documentation drift since v2.3.0
- Removed `profiles.yml` from project structure tree — file is not committed; added note pointing to CONTRIBUTING.md for profile setup

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### ML Feature Tables — 7 New Models

Built production-ready feature tables for 7 ML use cases across revenue optimization, marketing, and donor stewardship.

**New Models** (all in `ML_FEATURES` schema)

| Model | Target | Rows | Business Value |
|-------|--------|------|----------------|
| `ml_ticket_no_show_features` | `is_no_show` | 574 | Oversell high no-show slots → +revenue |
| `ml_retail_cross_sell_features` | `co_purchase_count` | 0* | Product bundling and POS cross-sell |
| `ml_email_send_time_features` | `was_opened` | 1,129 | Per-subscriber send time optimization |
| `ml_campaign_response_features` | `is_high_responder` | 300 | Target high-propensity members for fundraising |
| `ml_dynamic_pricing_features` | `suggested_price_multiplier` | 16,000 | Revenue optimization via demand-based pricing |
| `ml_donor_upgrade_propensity_features` | `is_upgrade_candidate` | 491 | Proactive stewardship for upgrade-ready donors |
| `ml_visitor_forecast_training` | `y` (visitor count) | 14 | Staff scheduling and capacity planning |

*Cross-sell awaits multi-item basket transactions in production data.

**Feature Engineering Highlights:**
- Ticket No-Show: customer historical no-show rate, ticket type base rate, purchase hour, anonymity flag
- Send Time: preferred open hour per subscriber, hours-from-preferred distance, time bucket encoding
- Dynamic Pricing: demand z-score vs benchmark, utilization band, suggested multiplier (0.85x–1.25x)
- Donor Upgrade: monthly value velocity, spend-to-next-tier gap, next tier target, engagement signals

**Exposures:** Added 7 new ML model exposures (15 total)
**Schema tests:** Added tests for all new feature tables (246 total)
**Model count: 45 → 52**

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Cortex Agent, Observability & Verified Query Framework

**Cortex Agent**
- Recreated `MUSEUM_DW_PROD.GOLD.MUSEUM_OPERATIONS_AGENT` with two semantic view tools:
  - `MUSEUM_OPERATIONS_DATA` → `SV_MUSEUM_OPERATIONS` (daily ops, tickets, retail, customers, LTV)
  - `DONOR_RETENTION_DATA` → `SV_DONOR_RETENTION` (retention, survival, capacity)
- Agent instructions include role-playing date guidance, LTV routing, and chart generation
- Granted `READ UNREDACTED AI OBSERVABILITY EVENTS TABLE` and `SNOWFLAKE.AI_OBSERVABILITY_READER` for full query tracking

**Observability & Pattern Detection**
- Created `MUSEUM_DW_PROD.MONITORING.AGENT_QUESTION_PATTERNS` table for storing topic clusters
- Created `MUSEUM_DW_PROD.MONITORING.ANALYZE_AGENT_QUESTION_GAPS` stored procedure:
  - Pulls last 24h of agent questions from observability events
  - Clusters by topic (Revenue, Tickets, Retail, Members, Retention, Capacity, Forecasting, etc.)
  - Detects coverage gaps: >50% failure = HIGH, >30% = MEDIUM, 10+ questions = INFO
  - Sends email alert via `MUSEUM_EMAIL_ALERTS` notification integration
- Created `MUSEUM_DW_PROD.MONITORING.TASK_AGENT_PATTERN_ANALYSIS` task (daily at 8 AM ET)
- Created `MUSEUM_EMAIL_ALERTS` notification integration → jmyers@911memorial.org

**Verified Query Framework** (`analyses/verified_queries/`)
- 30 certified verified queries across 8 business domains:
  - `revenue_operations/` (7) — DOW, daily/monthly trends, weekend, fiscal year, net, payment
  - `ticket_sales/` (5) — by type, AOV trend, discounts, utilization, purchase-to-entry
  - `visitor_experience/` (2) — hourly traffic, by gate
  - `retail/` (2) — by category, top products
  - `membership/` (3) — LTV by segment, by tier, by membership type

  - `donor_retention/` (5) — by tier, by membership, survival curve, at-risk, churn
  - `capacity_planning/` (5) — availability, sold-out, peak demand, weekend, half-life
- Each domain has `_verified_queries.yml` with governance metadata:
  - stakeholder_owner, adm_reference, approved_by, approved_date, tags, power_bi_datasets
- SQL files use `SEMANTIC_VIEW()` syntax for direct validation
- `macros/operations/sync_verified_queries.sql` — run-operation to list/validate all VQRs
- `analyses/verified_queries/README.md` — full documentation of conventions and governance

**Semantic View Updates**
- `SV_MUSEUM_OPERATIONS` expanded to 20 verified queries (was 6)
- `SV_DONOR_RETENTION` expanded to 10 verified queries (was 4)

**Model count: 45 models | 30 analyses | 170 tests | 487 macros**

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-18

### Ticket Capacity & Availability Pipeline

**New Snowflake Objects**
- `BRONZE.RAW_TICKET_CAPACITY` — capacity configuration table (date, 30-min entry window, ticket type, capacity)
- `BRONZE.RAW_POS_TICKETS.ENTRY_TIME_PURCHASED` — new column added for reservation window tracking

**New dbt Models** (5 files)
- `models/staging/stg_ticket_capacity.sql` — staging view for capacity source
